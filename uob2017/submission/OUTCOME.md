Dear All,
 
I would very much like to thank you for the entering the inaugural Engineering Art competition.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and number of entries we received.  This made judging a challenge but,  after much reflection, the following have been selected as the outright winners:
 
George Marrs
Amelia Rouse (submission 2)
Galen Reich
Shen-huo4
 
Additional special commendation
Gabrielle Chester
 
(Please note the above are in no particular order).  As stated, the quality of submissions was very high and as such, we will endeavour to ensure they are displayed appropriately. We will be in touch with the winners separately to inform them of the prizes.
 
Best wishes,
 
Mark

***MESSAGE FROM PROF MARK STERLING, HEAD OF SCHOOL***

Dear All,

Welcome to the University. Engineering is often said to be more of an art than a science, so I thought you may like an opportunity to embrace your artistic side, celebrate your creativity and at the same time make the place look a bit nicer.  So, the School has decided to launch its first Engineering through art competition.  The rules are relatively straightforward:

  1.  All entries close by 31st October 2017 and submitted to eng-office@contacts.bham.ac.uk<mailto:eng-office@contacts.bham.ac.uk>.
  2.  All entries must be electronic in nature, the engineering connection and in particular the link to the School must be obvious.
  3.  Your entries cannot contain any health and safety violations.  (If they do, you will be asked why you did not address this rather than stopping to take a photograph etc.)
  4.  The judge’s decision is final!
There are four prizes of £500 pounds available - three prizes which celebrate the respective disciplines in the School and an overall prize.  Depending on how many entries we get, we might look to do more than a simple competition or we may decide never to run this again - it is up to you!

I look forward to seeing you soon and do not forget your jokes!


Best wishes,


Michelle Worrall
